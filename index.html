            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>In a changing world, there are several challenges a country such as Australia faces moving forward and
                planning to combat these intergenerational challenges are necessary to move forward to the year 2050.
                Climate change is one of the most significant challenges to Australia’s long-term economic
                sustainability. Australia will be one of the countries hardest and fastest hit. Additionally, A growing
                population will help manage pressures of the ageing population but will put pressure on our
                infrastructure, services, and environment. <br><br> Population growth and an aging population are some
                of the significant challenges that Australia faces as
                move forward. Australia’s population will continue to grow over time but at slower rates than in the
                past. A growing population will help manage pressures of the ageing population but will put pressure on
                our infrastructure, services, and environment. This will require continued planning and investment ahead
                of time. <br><br> Australia’s population is ageing. Between now and 2050 the number of: older people (65
                to 84 years) are expected to more than double; very old people (85 and over) is expected to more than
                quadruple, from 0.4 million people today to 1.8 million in 2050. In contrast, the number of children is
                expected to increase by 45 per cent; prime age working people is expected to increase by 44 per cent.

            <h2>Future Planning</h2>

            <p> Significant planning and action are required to meet the needs and tackle the challenges that will be
                faced as a result of significant fiscal and environmental consequences of the past and future. The fiscal strategy will keep real
                growth in spending to 2 per cent,
                when the economy is growing
                strongly, until the Budget returns
                to surplus. It will bring structural
                improvements to the Budget,
                reducing the fiscal pressures
                of ageing and escalating
                health costs. 
                <br><br>The
                Government has already begun to take steps to address some of the fiscal challenges presented by an
                ageing population and the locking in of permanent increases in spending over the past decade. Whenever
                the economy is growing strongly, the Government’s fiscal strategy commits to limiting real growth in
                spending to 2 per cent per annum until the budget returns to surplus and allowing tax receipts to
                recover naturally as the economy strengthens. Implementation of the Government’s fiscal strategy will
                reduce ongoing spending by around one percentage point of GDP from 2015-16 onwards.

            <h2>Electric Vehicles</h2>

            <p>While government modelling forecasts 90 per cent of vehicles will be electric by 2050, Electric vehicle only make up one percent of all vehicles on Australian roads says energy and environmental economist Dr Marjan Nazifi, a lecturer in the Department of Economics at the Macquarie Business School. He also states that “Currently, Australians have access to about 33 passenger EV models from 13 different car manufacturers, with the price ranging between $40,990 to $176,918,” says Nazifi. “There are now around 15 EV models in Australia priced under $65,000.
                “Our findings suggest that a $10,000 reduction in the price of EVs could lead to a 17 per cent to 42 per cent increase in market share.”
                 <br><br>
                 Some of the significant challenges that are faced by the electric vehicle industry is of the significant issues with expansion need for infrastructure for charging stations and battery storage to produce and store clean energy which has been produced through wind, solar or many other clean methods. <br><br> However, what’s more important is what the governments policy plans for clean energy look like and their commitments to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In the former prime ministers modelling of the policies for climate change, transport only covered a small part of modelling with little to no technical goals set out. However, it is assumed by 2050, the proportion of electric vehicles will increase from the current 1% to 90% of registered vehicles in Australia.
